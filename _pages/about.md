I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Monash University in 2023, advised by [Prof. Daniel Harabor](https://harabor.net/daniel/) and [Prof. Peter Stuckey](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/pstuckey/).
My research focuses on heuristic search and automated planning, with strong connections to urban computing, the Internet of Things, and robotics. During my PhD research, I developed high-performance algorithms for path planning in various environments. This experience gives me a deep understanding of complex planning algorithms, creative thinking to improve them, and a broader view of research topics in the field.

Beyond my PhD research, I have also been involved in a diverse range of research and industrial software development, which has equipped me with excellent engineering skills, including implementation, problem-solving, and data analysis.

Other areas that interest me are multi-agent path planning, traffic optimisation, and general problem-solving techniques such as constraint programming, mixed integer programming, and local search. Additionally, I am open to modern techniques for data-driven tasks, such as predict+optimisation and machine learning.
