I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Monash University in 2023, advised by [Prof. Daniel Harabor](https://harabor.net/daniel/) and [Prof. Peter Stuckey](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/pstuckey/).
My research focuses on heuristic search and automated planning, with strong connections to urban computing, the Internet of Things, and robotics. During my PhD research, I developed high-performance algorithms for path planning in various environments. This experience gives me a deep understanding of complex planning algorithms, creative thinking to improve them, and a broader view of research topics in AI field.

Other areas that interest me are multi-agent path planning, traffic optimisation, and general problem-solving techniques such as constraint programming, mixed integer programming, and local search. Additionally, I am open to modern techniques for data-driven tasks, such as predict+optimisation and machine learning.

Beyond research, I have also been involved in a diverse range of software projects. These experiences have equipped me with excellent engineering skills, including proficiency in implementation, problem-solving, and data analysis. As a software developer, I am proficient in C++ and Python and specialise in high-performance computing, low-level optimisation (cache-aware, SIMD, etc.), and Linux-based platforms.
